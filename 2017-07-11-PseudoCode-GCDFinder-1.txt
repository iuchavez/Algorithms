The algorithm for finding the gcd is going to use mod
I think that a recursive approach would take a number and recursivly find the numbers that divide it evenly which are less than intself

So that would probably look like

int gcd(a,b){
	recursiveGcd(a, a, c)
}

int recursiveGcd(a,b,c){ //where a = b
	if(b <= 1){
		return 1;
	}
	
	maxCd = recursiveGcd(a, b-1,c);

	
	if(a%b = 0){
		if(c%b = 0){
			cd = b;
		}
	}

	return max(maxCd, cd)
}

max(a, b){
	if(a >= b){
		return a;
	}
	return c;
}
